# simulating-spins-qmio

This repository gathers the scripts provided by the authors of the paper [Simulating spin dynamics with quantum computers](https://pubs.aip.org/aapt/ajp/article-abstract/93/1/98/3327065/Simulating-spin-dynamics-with-quantum-computers?redirectedFrom=PDF) but adapted for working with `FakeQmio`, a `BackendV2` object from `qsikit` that incorporates the noise model from CESGA's quantum computer Qmio. This `FakeQmio` backend is imported from [gomeztato/qmiotools](https://github.com/gomeztato/qmiotools).
